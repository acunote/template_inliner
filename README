Template inliner avoids the problem when to render a large list of objects,
Rails creates a large number of View instances, requiring additional CPU and memory
for each of them.

Example situation:
    <% for object in objects %>   #1000 times
        <%= render :partial => 'object', :locals => { :object => object } %>
    <% end %>


Template inliner will include the source of the partial into the
template where it's rendered from before Rails starts processing the template.

To use, just add :inline => true to the 'render' call.
Note, the entire call to render inlined partial must be on the one line for
template inliner to work.

Example:
    <% for object in objects %>   #1000 times
        <%= render :partial => 'object', :locals => { :object => object }, :inline => true %>
    <% end %>
